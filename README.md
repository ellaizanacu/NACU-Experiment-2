# **EXPERIMENT 2 - NUMERICAL PYTHON (NUMPY)**

## 1. NORMALIZATION PROBLEM: 
**Function Used:** *import numpy as np*

**Description:** This function imports the entire NumPy library, a tool for numerical computing in Python, and gives it a shortened alias as 'np' to use it.

**Function Used:** *def normalize_array(X):*

**Description:** This defines a function called 'normalize_array' that will take an ndarray 'X' as input and return its normalized version.

**Function Used:** *if not isinstance(X, np.ndarray):*

**Description:** This function checks if the input 'X' is not a NumPy ndarray. If 'X' is not a valid ndarray, the function will stop here.

**Function Used:** *return "Input is not a NumPy array."*

**Description:** This function returns a message to let the user know that the input is not a NumPy ndarray.

**Function Used:** *if X.size == 0:*

**Description:** This function checks if the input ndarray is empty. If the ndarray has no elements, it wonâ€™t make sense to normalize it.

**Function Used:** *return "Array is empty."*

**Description:** This function returns a message to let the user know that the ndarray is empty.

**Function Used:** *X_mean = X.mean()*

**Description:** This function calculates the mean (average) of all the elements in the ndarray X.

**Function Used:** *X_std = X.std()*

**Description:** This function computes the standard deviation of all the elements in the ndarray X.

**Function Used:** *return (X - X_mean) / X_std*

**Description:** This function returns the normalized version of the ndarray 'X' by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, resulting in an ndarray where the values have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

**Function Used:** *X = np.random.random((5,5))*

**Description:** This function generates a 5x5 ndarray with randomly drawn numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.

**Function Used:** *X_normalized = normalize_array(X)*

**Description:** This function calls the 'normalize_array' function, passing the ndarray 'X' as input. It stores the result, which is the normalized version of 'X', in the variable 'X_normalized'.

**Function Used:** *np.save('X_normalized.npy', X_normalized)*

**Description:** This function saves the normalized ndarray 'X_normalized' to a file named 'X_normalized.npy' for later use.

**Function Used:** *print(X_normalized)*

**Description:** This function prints and displays the value for the ndarray 'X_normalized'.

## 2. DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM:
**Function Used:** *import numpy as np*

**Description:** This function imports the entire NumPy library, a tool for numerical computing in Python, and gives it a shortened alias as 'np' to use it.

**Function Used:** *def find_divisible_by_3():*

**Description:** This defines a function called 'find_divisible_by_3' to create an ndarray of squared integers and find the ones that are divisible by 3.

**Function Used:** *A = np.arange(1, 101).reshape(10, 10) ** 2*

**Description:** The function 'np.arange(1, 101)' creates an ndarray of the first 100 positive integers and the function '.reshape(10, 10)' reshapes the ndarray into a 10x10 ndarray. This function results in a 10x10 ndarray where each element is the square of the numbers from 1 to 100.

**Function Used:** *div_by_3 = A[A % 3 == 0]*

**Description:** This function extracts all the elements from the ndarray A that are divisible by 3.

**Function Used:** *return A, div_by_3*

**Description:** This function returns 'A', the original ndarray of squared integers, and 'div_by_3', which contains only the elements from 'A' that are divisible by 3.

**Function Used:** *A, div_by_3 = find_divisible_by_3()*

**Description:** This function calls 'find_divisible_by_3' and stores the original ndrray in 'A' and the elements divisible by 3 in 'div_by_3'.

**Function Used:** *np.save('div_by_3.npy', div_by_3)*

**Description:** This function saves the elements that are divisible by 3 into a file named 'div_by_3.npy'.

**Function Used:** *print("\n Elements Divisible by 3: \n", div_by_3)*

**Description:** This function prints and displays the list of elements from ndarray A that are divisible by 3.
